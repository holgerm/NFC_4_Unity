# NFC_4_Unity
An NFC Plugin for Unity (Android)

## Build the Plugin From Android Sources ##

In *NFC4UnityJava/build.xml* you find an ant file. Use the target *build-plugin* to build the Unity plugin. It will be created in *NFC4UnityPlugin/Assets/Plugins/Android*. You will find all necessary files (incl. AndroidManifest.xml, libs folder etc.) there. So you can open the unity project in the parent folder *NFC4UnityPlugin/Assets* where you put your own Unity files into and build your app for Android.
